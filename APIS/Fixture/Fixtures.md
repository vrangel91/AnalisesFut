Fixtures
For all requests to fixtures you can add the query parameter timezone to your request in order to retrieve the list of matches in the time zone of your choice like “Europe/London“

To know the list of available time zones you have to use the endpoint timezone.

LIVE	In Progress	In Play	Used in very rare cases. It indicates a fixture in progress but the data indicating the half-time or elapsed time are not available
Fixtures with the status TBD may indicate an incorrect fixture date or time because the fixture date or time is not yet known or final. Fixtures with this status are checked and updated daily. The same applies to fixtures with the status PST, CANC.

The fixtures ids are unique and specific to each fixture. In no case an ID will change.

Not all competitions have livescore available and only have final result. In this case, the status remains in NS and will be updated in the minutes/hours following the match (this can take up to 48 hours, depending on the competition).

Although the data is updated every 15 seconds, depending on the competition there may be a delay between reality and the availability of data in the API.

Update Frequency : This endpoint is updated every 15 seconds.

Recommended Calls : 1 call per minute for the leagues, teams, fixtures who have at least one fixture in progress otherwise 1 call per day.
